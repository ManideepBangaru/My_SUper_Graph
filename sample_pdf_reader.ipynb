       "\"Pitch to Raw Fury 2\\n\\n\\n**What is this game?**\\n\\n_My Work Is Not Yet Done_ is a narrative-driven investigative horror game, combining\\nelements of the survival/simulation genres with a dense, nonlinear plot exploring the\\nimbrication and dissolution of human identities/meanings within uncanny wilderness.\\n\\n_Work_ follows the final days of the inquisitor Avery, the last remaining survivor of a\\ndoomed excursionary mission into a remote and unaccountable stretch of old\\ncountry. Tasked with tracking down the source of an inscrutable signal, she must\\nnavigate, survey and survive an eerie, ever-shifting landscape reclaimed by nature\\n— and perhaps something stranger.\\n\\nIt is currently scheduled for release in 2021/2022 for Windows, across Steam ($20),\\nitch.io ($20 recommended, pay-what-you-can), and GitHub (open-source). It is being\\ndeveloped in GameMaker Studio 2.\\n\\n[You can view a trailer here, and a monthly development log here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmwlUFxTwc0)\\n\\n\\n**Who am I?**\\n\\nMy name's Spencer, I’m an American video game designer and developer based out\\nof the NY/NJ metropolitan area. I have a particular interest in narrative design. A lot\\nof my work revolves around the interrogation of the relationship between player and\\nauthorial agency. Basically, I spend a lot of time thinking about how to design stories\\nand mechanics that subvert and frustrate player expectations in (hopefully)\\ninteresting ways.\\n\\n_My Work Is Not Yet Done_ is my first major commercial project, but I have a good\\namount of experience working within the industry (at the very least, enough to have\\nsurvived and remained nominally solvent up until this point). I’m certain in my ability\\nand resolve to see this through to the end.\\n\\n\\nproject: _My Work Is Not Yet Done_\\nauthor: Spencer Yan (@spncryn)\\nemail: spenceryan123 [at] Gmail\\n\\n\\n\""
